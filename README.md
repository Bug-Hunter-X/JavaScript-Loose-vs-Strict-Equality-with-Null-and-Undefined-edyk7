# JavaScript Loose vs Strict Equality with Null and Undefined

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to the loose (==) and strict (===) equality operators when handling null and undefined values.  The code shows three functions that illustrate this difference and the importance of explicit handling of undefined values.

## Problem

The use of loose equality (==) can lead to unexpected results when comparing values to null and undefined.  Strict equality (===) is more predictable. The handling of undefined values is crucial for robust code.
